        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Avita and I made this website to share my love for baking with you. Baking has always been more than just a hobby for me—it’s a form of creativity, a science, and a way to bring joy to others. From the moment I first measured out flour and sugar as a child, I knew there was something magical about the process. The transformation of simple ingredients into something delicious is both fascinating and rewarding. Whether it's the precise techniques required for a perfect sourdough loaf or the artistic freedom of decorating a cake, baking offers endless possibilities for learning and innovation.</p>
        <p>Over the years, I have explored various aspects of baking, from classic pastries to rustic bread-making. I love experimenting with new flavors and techniques, always striving to improve my skills. Beyond the science of baking, there’s also an emotional element as baking for friends and family brings a sense of warmth and connection. There’s nothing quite like seeing someone’s face light up after tasting a homemade treat. It’s a reminder that food is not just nourishment but also a shared experience.</p>
        <p>Through this website, I hope to share my passion for baking, offering insights, recipes, and tips that will inspire others to explore the joy of baking. Whether you are a beginner looking to make your first batch of cookies or an experienced baker aiming to refine your techniques, I believe there is always something new to discover in the world of baking.</p>
